--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

    1. I included an image in my about section with a descriptive alt attribute.
    2. I included headings for each of my sections as well as paragraph text to go with the headings.
    3. I have links to different pages. For example, the Resume and Linkedin buttons go to external links as well as the buttons in my projects section.
    4. I have a footer tag at the bottom of the page.

(b) CSS features

    1. I have padding and margins to enhance readability. For example, my About section has padding on the outside as well as the inside.
    2. I modified the link, text color, and background colors with a "clean" color palette. 

(c) Advanced features

    1. I have a navigation bar that is responsive depending on how big the screen is.

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

    It took me about 9 hours to complete this assignment.

4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

    I used the bootstrap website to help me make the grids and responsiveness. For example, it helped me make the rows and columns. I also used pinterest to help me find a 
    color palette. I also used ChatGPT to help me create a hover effect on buttons. My prompt was along the lines of: How do I create a hover effect on a button using CSS? 
    I also wanted to learn how to make my images more adaptable so I asked the bot: How can I make my image smaller when the screen is smaller? I used ChatGPT's answers as
    a reference but I changed the colors, sizes, and other aspects to make it my own style.

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
